### why hello there 👋

I see you've stumbled upon my code cave - it's nice to have you here! I'm Farzana, a Design Engineering student at Imperial College London. Here you can find the repositories for some of my uni project work as well as personal projects like my portfolio website and a weather extension for Chrome. ✨✨✨

🎹 I'm currently working on developing an app that animates virtual hands based on inputted music scores in Unity 🎹

Check out my other projects (including both code and physical builds) on [my portfolio site](www.farzanazainal.com) 🐈
