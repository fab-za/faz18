### why hello there ðŸ‘‹

I see you've stumbled upon my code cave - it's nice to have you here! I'm Farzana, a Design Engineering student at Imperial College London. Here you can find the repositories for some of my uni project work as well as personal projects like my portfolio website and a weather extension for Chrome. âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨

Check out all my projects (both code and physical builds) on [my portfolio site](www.farzanazainal.com)
